How to install Packages:

apt is package manager for Ubuntu. apt-get 
For Amazon linuc CLI "YUM" is used.

In Ubuntu: 

apt install <packageName> --> Installs the package from your account.
sudo apt install <Packagename> --> Installs it using the root account.
sudo apt update --> Updates all the pacakges we have
sudo apt upgrade --> Upgrades all the packages we have
sudo apt purge --> Delete any of the pacakges.
sudo apt purge git --> Deletes the git package.

Connect to an EC2 instance:

From terminal:

ssh -i harsha.pem ubuntu@public_IP_address (helps us to remote login into server from local machine)


pwd --> present working directory.
whoami --> current user
sudo su --> current user to root user 
history --> gives all the commands used in active terminal.
git --version: gives the version of git
which docker --> Gives the path of docker
sudo apt update git --> updates git
date --> tells you the current date.

Vim: It is similar to nano, you could also use vim to edit the file.

vi <file> --> Inside the esiting file you have to start with I and then after finishing you have to press escape + I = Insert mode and so you could type something, then a colon symbol appers.

qa! --> exit without saving.
wq --> save and exit.

NETWORK COMMANDS:

ping google.com --> check if particular site is up or not. Checks if there is connection between servers.
ip addr --> gives our IP address.
nslookup google.com --> gives the data of name, ip address.

curl https://www.google.com --> we can see the whole page, in html foem.
curl https://aws.amazon.com --> Gives the whole page, in html form, to have information and context of it.

wget --> download the files.
wget https://www.python.org/ftp --> It download the package/image that is given in link.


Difference between bash and dash?

#!/bin/sh
#!/bin/bash
#!/bin/dash
#!/bin/ksh


./ <file.ext> --> to execute a file
sh <file.ext> --> file gets executed, but you will get denied as it doesn't know who has access to execute file.

So we use command line, chmod this grants permessions.
ch --> change + mod 

What are permessions ?
It's basically divide into 3 parts
1) root (SU)
2) which group
3) What are your permessions

Using the numbers we categorize this permessions:
7 --> magic number (read, write and execute)

4 --> read
2 --> write
1 --> execute

Ex: chmod 444 (root 4, group 4, everyone 4)
    chmod 777 (root (read, write,execute); group (read, write,execute); everyone (read, write,execute))

User:  
Group: 
Everyone: 

To monitor the CPU/RAM how do we identify ?

for CPU you can use --> NPROC
for RAM you could use --> Free

Insted of there you could use TOP command.
It gives you all the informations of all processes, how much memory is used.

TOP --> which all processes are running on your account.
